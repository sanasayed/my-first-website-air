    <p>Motion Sickness

<p>In-flight turbulence is not always avoidable. If prone to motion sickness, the following suggested measures could help:

<p>Avoid a late evening with spicy food and alcoholic beverages the previous day.

<p>Request for a seat in middle section of the aircraft (preferably a window seat).
Do not have alcoholic drinks on the day of the flight.
Have a light dry snack (e.g. biscuits/toast) 2 hours prior to flight Have a light meal on board the aircraft.
Avoid alcohol but have plenty of water / juices.
If nausea is encountered, open the air vents, keep the head still, lie back with seat in reclining position, close your eyes and relax.
Use the airsickness bag well in time.
As an added precaution, consult your physician before flight and take medication as advised.
Do not experiment with self-medication.

<p>Fear of flying

<p>Especially on a first flight, a little apprehension is quite understandable, but a century of manned flight has made flying very safe. To help you relax and enjoy the flight, the following tips are recommended.

<p>Adjust your seat in a reclining position - unless advised otherwise by the cabin crew.
Close eyes.
Breathe in, count three and breathe out counting three, for 10 - 15 minutes.
Imagine a pleasant environment, concentrate on relaxing every part of the body and feel the tension drain away.
The best is to look of out the window and enjoy the flight! Consult your physician before flight and take medication as advised. A visit to a clinical psychologist may help in ridding you of your fears permanently.
<p>Changes in cabin pressure

<p>Even in a pressurized aircraft, minor changes in cabin pressure do occur during take-off and landing, resulting at times in discomfort due to blocked ears. This occurs particularly in guests who fly despite having colds, upper respiratory tract infections. This can be avoided by equalizing the pressure in your middle ear by following these easy steps:

<p>Suck on a boiled sweet. Your cabin crew would be delighted to provide you with boiled sweets.
Yawn, swallow saliva, and perform side-to-side movements of the jaw.
Avoid sleeping during take-off & landing.
Children should be given fluids to drink / sweets to suck on & infants / toddlers could benefit from sucking on pacifiers / milk bottles.
Pinch your nose and blow - especially during descent.
Finally, if you have a cold or ear infection, see your physician before flying. Use of Nasal Drops (as prescribed by your physician) is recommended before take-off & landing in these cases.
<p>Food and Drinks

<p>In-flight cuisine is yours to savor and enjoy. Sometimes changes in cabin pressure can cause mild bloating and discomfort. These simple steps will ensure that you enjoy your meal and flight:

<p>Avoid heavy meals (may cause indigestion due to expansion of gases in the intestines) and over-indulgence in alcohol.
Drink plenty of fluids. Water and fresh juices are recommended. Avoid excessive intake of tea, coffee, aerated waters as these aggravate dehydration.

<p>Existing Medical Conditions – Check section on Carriage of Invalid / Disabled Guests
